    # The knots are a list of degree+N-1 numbers, where N is the number of control points. 
    # Sometimes this list of numbers is called the knot vector. In this term, the word vector does not mean 3‑D direction.
    # This list of knot numbers must satisfy several technical conditions. 
    # The standard way to ensure that the technical conditions are satisfied is to require the 
    # numbers to stay the same or get larger as you go down the list and to limit the number of duplicate 
    # values to no more than the degree. For example, for a degree 3 NURBS curve with 11 control points, 
    # the list of numbers 0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,7,7,9,9,9 is a satisfactory list of knots. 
    # The list 0,0,0,1,2,2,2,2,7,7,9,9,9 is unacceptable because there are four 2s and four is larger than the degree.
    # The number of times a knot value is duplicated is called the knot’s multiplicity. 
    # In the preceding example of a satisfactory list of knots, the knot value 0 has multiplicity three, the knot value 1 has multiplicity one, the knot value 2 has multiplicity three, the knot value 3 has multiplicity one, the knot value 7 has multiplicity two, and the knot value 9 has multiplicity three. A knot value is said to be a full-multiplicity knot if it is duplicated degree many times. In the example, the knot values 0, 2, and 9 have full multiplicity. A knot value that appears only once is called a simple knot. In the example, the knot values 1 and 3 are simple knots.
    # If a list of knots starts with a full multiplicity knot, is followed by simple knots, 
    # terminates with a full multiplicity knot, and the values are equally spaced, then the knots are called uniform. 
    # For example, if a degree 3 NURBS curve with 7 control points has knots 0,0,0,1,2,3,4,4,4, 
    # then the curve has uniform knots. The knots 0,0,0,1,2,5,6,6,6 are not uniform. Knots that are not 
    # uniform are called non‑uniform. The N and U in NURBS stand for non‑uniform and indicate that the 
    # knots in a NURBS curve are permitted to be non-uniform.
    # Duplicate knot values in the middle of the knot list make a NURBS curve less smooth. 
    # At the extreme, a full multiplicity knot in the middle of the knot list means there is a 
    # place on the NURBS curve that can be bent into a sharp kink. For this reason, some designers like to add and 
    # remove knots and then adjust control points to make curves have smoother or kinkier shapes. 
    # Since the number of knots is equal to (N+degree‑1), where N is the number of control points, 
    # adding knots also adds control points and removing knots removes control points. 
    # Knots can be added without changing the shape of a NURBS curve. 
    # In general, removing knots will change the shape of a curve.
