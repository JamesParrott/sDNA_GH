""" Unload the sDNA_GH Python package and all sDNA modules, by removing them from GhPython's shared cache (sys.modules).  The 
    next sDNA_GH component to run will then reload the package and installation-wide options file (config.toml), and any specified 
    options including a project specific config.toml, without otherwise having to restart Rhino to clear its cache.
