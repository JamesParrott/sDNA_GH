Vector Source

Grasshopper_Icon_Set.zip

The files were written with Xara Designer Pro 6, but Xara is pretty good at file compatibility so you can probably open them on many versions.

You are free to use and modify these vector graphics for any project, document or webpage that is associated with Grasshopper. 
You do not need to credit me, though it is not allowed to pass the work off as your own without modifications.
